<!-- 
A teammate of yours started working on the app below, but needs some help. First, they used all div tags, so there's no way of knowing what the content is. Re-structure the HTML with semantic tags. Second, this page is not accessible. Re-structure the HTML to make it work correctly for screen readers. Next, write a function that listens for the user to enter their first name in the form below, and generates a string with the reply, "It's so nice to meet you, [name]!" Finally, the string that's displayed should be centered horizontally, and all font on the page should be sans-serif.
